# analytics-projects
This repository contains all the projects I developed for my analytics class. Here you will find a variety of projects that demonstrate my ability to apply analytical concepts and techniques to solve real-world problems. Each project includes a detailed report outlining the problem, methodology, results, and conclusions.
